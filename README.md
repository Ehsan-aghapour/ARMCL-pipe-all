# ARMCL-PipeALL
Pipe-line implementation in ARM Compute Library (See pipe-all branch).

git clone https://github.com/Ehsan-aghapour/ARMCL-PipeALL.git -b pipe-all

# Run the Pipe-all
We create the pipe-all for AlexNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet, ResNet50 and SqueezeNet graphs. The pipe-all versions of these graphs are graph_AlexNet_all_pipe_sync, graph_GoogleNet_all_pipe_sync, graph_MobileNet_all_pipe_sync, graph_ResNet50_all_pipe_sync, and graph_SqueezeNet_all_pipe_sync respectively.

After compiling the source code and preparing the libraries based on your platform run the following command:

./graph_AlexNet_all_pip_sync --threads=4 --threads2=2 --total_cores=6 --partition_point=3 --partition_point2=5 --order=G-L-B --n=60 --image=data_dir/images/ --data=data_dir/ --labels=data_dir/label.txt
<br/>
<br/>
--threads: Number of threads for Big cluster.<br/>
--threads2: Number of threads for little cluster.<br/>
--total_cores: Number of all cores of CPU. <br/>
--partition_point: The first partitioning point. First partitioning will happen after layer specified with this argument.<br/>
--partition_point2: The second partitioning point. second partitioning will happen after layer specified with this argument.<br/>
--order: The order of components in the pipeline. (G:GPU, B:CPU Big cluster, L:CPU Little cluster). For example G-B-L order means first subgraph runs in GPU, Second subgraph runs in CPU Big cluster and third subgraph runs in CPU little cluster.<br/>
--n: Number or runs. For example 60 means running graph for 60 frames.<br/>

The following image, data and lablels should specified if you want to run the graph for real data. But if you want to run the network for dummy data (random data and image) do not specify this arguments:<br/>
--image: dir which include image files. graph will run for images inside this dir.<br/>
--data: dir of graph parameters.<br/>
--labels: label file<br/>

The following parts explain compiling and running ARMCL for android and linux platforms.
<br/>
<br/>

# Compiling for Android

First it is required to prepare cross compile tools to compile source code in linux system for android target. Here is the steps to download and settup tools.

1- Download Android NDK:<br/>
https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads

2- We should create a standalone toolchains for compiling source code for android. Based on your platform set --arch to arm or arm64 in the following command. $corss-compile-dir is your arbitrary dir at which cross compile toolchains will be created.<br/>

$NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --arch arm/arm64 --api 23 --stl gnustl --install-dir $cross_compile_dir<br/>

This command create cross compile toolchains at $cross-compile-dir.

3- Add $cross-compile-dir/bin to the path:<br/>
export PATH=$cross-compile-dir/bin/:$PATH

4- Go to the ARMCL source dir (cd $ARMCL-source-dir) and use the following command to compile it. Based on your platform set arch to armv7a or arm64-v8a in this command.<br/>
CXX=clang++ CC=clang scons Werror=0 debug=0 asserts=0 neon=1 opencl=1 os=android arch=armv7a/arm64-v8a -j8

# Compiling for linux
For cross compiling the source code in linux host for linux host you require:<br/>
gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf for 32 bit target <br/>
gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu for 64 bit target

Then use the following command to compile. Based on your platform set arch to armv7a or arm64-v8a in this command.<br/>
scons Werror=0 -j16 debug=0 asserts=0 neon=1 opencl=1 os=linux arch=armv7a/arm64-v8a


# Running in Android
For android it is required to specify the path of libOpenCL.so. First copy this library into an arbitrary dir ($lib_dir) and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to this dir:<br/>
cp /system/lib64/egl/libGLES_mali.so $lib_dir/libOpenCL.so <br/>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$lib_dir

Now it is ready to run built binaries in build dir of ARMCL. <br/> <br/>
For AlexNet there is a zip file of model paramters, sample images and a label file. So you can run this graph for real data and see the results. For this purpose first download this zip file at: <br/> https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Arm%20Developer%20Community/Images/Tutorial%20Guide%20Diagrams%20and%20Screenshots/Machine%20Learning/Running%20AlexNet%20on%20Pi%20with%20Compute%20Library/compute_library_alexnet.zip?revision=c1a232fa-f328-451f-9bd6-250b83511e01&la=en&hash=7371AEC619F8192A9DE3E42FE6D9D18B5119E30C

make a directory and extract this zip file: <br/>
mkdir $assets_alexnet <br/>
unzip compute_library_alexnet.zip -d $assets_alexnet
<br/> <br/>
Run the AlexNet graph with this command. Select NEON or CL to run it on CPU or GPU respectively: <br/>
./build/examples/graph_alexnet Neon/CL $assets_alexnet $assets_alexnet/go_kart.ppm $assets_alexnet/labels.txt


# Running in Linux
For linux in addition to libOpencL.so, these three libraries should be copied into target. So first copy these libraries from the ARMCL dir:<br/>
cp build/libarm_compute.so build/libarm_compute_core.so build/libarm_compute_graph.so $lib_dir
<br/>
Then copy libOpenCL.so into $lib_dir and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to them:<br/>
cp /system/lib64/egl/libGLES_mali.so $lib_dir/libOpenCL.so <br/>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$lib_dir

Now it is ready to run built binaries in build dir of ARMCL. <br/> <br/>
For AlexNet there is a zip file of model paramters, sample images and a label file. So you can run this graph for real data and see the results. For this purpose first download this zip file at: <br/> https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Arm%20Developer%20Community/Images/Tutorial%20Guide%20Diagrams%20and%20Screenshots/Machine%20Learning/Running%20AlexNet%20on%20Pi%20with%20Compute%20Library/compute_library_alexnet.zip?revision=c1a232fa-f328-451f-9bd6-250b83511e01&la=en&hash=7371AEC619F8192A9DE3E42FE6D9D18B5119E30C

make a directory and extract this zip file: <br/>
mkdir $assets_alexnet <br/>
unzip compute_library_alexnet.zip -d $assets_alexnet
<br/> <br/>
Run the AlexNet graph with this command. Select NEON or CL to run it on CPU or GPU respectively: <br/>
./build/examples/graph_alexnet Neon/CL $assets_alexnet $assets_alexnet/go_kart.ppm $assets_alexnet/labels.txt
